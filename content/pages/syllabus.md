Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitation: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no prerequisites for this class. In practice, however, people who do well tend to have some experience proving things, or have done a lot of math or computer science. If you're a freshman, you might consider waiting a year before signing up.

Difficulty
----------

Here are the levels of philosophical and mathematical demandingness of each of the topics we'll discuss:

{{< resource "36a0be91-270a-684f-988d-d77314b882c7" >}}

*   On the **philosophical** side, a demandingness level of 100% means that some of the ideas we'll be discussing are rather subtle; you won't need philosophical training to understand them, but you'll have to think about them very carefully.
*   On the **mathematical** side, a demandingness level of 100% means that the lecture is designed for someone who is familiar with college-level mathematics or is otherwise experienced in mathematical proof.

Textbook
--------

There is a required textbook, which you should use to supplement your understanding of the lectures and as an aid to completing problem sets:

Pop quizzes and surveys

_During some lectures, there will be pop quizzes or surveys. A pop quiz consists of multiple choice questions on material discussed in the current or preceding lecture. You'll have to answer a quiz correctly to get credit. A pop survey is a questionnaire aimed at figuring out where the group stands on some issue. All it takes to get full credit on a survey is to participate. Your final Pop Quiz and Survey grade is the result of averaging your pop quiz and survey scores across the semester, after dropping your lowest score._

Recitation section attendance

_Attending recitation sections is mandatory. For each recitation meeting, you will be assigned a grade of 100% if you attend, or 0% if you fail to attend. (Tardiness may count as an absence, at your TA's discretion.) Your lowest attendance grade will be dropped._
